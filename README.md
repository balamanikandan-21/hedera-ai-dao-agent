# 🤖 AI Agent DAO Decision Engine

An intelligent governance assistant that helps decentralized communities make faster, smarter decisions. It summarizes DAO discussions using AI, generates actionable proposals, and allows members to vote on-chain via Hedera Token Service or Smart Contracts.

## 🚀 Project Overview

DAOs often struggle with decision paralysis due to long, chaotic discussions. Our AI-powered agent solves this by:

- Summarizing discussions using LLMs (GPT-4)
- Generating 1–3 actionable proposals
- Allowing members to vote via Hedera
- Storing decisions immutably using Hedera's services
